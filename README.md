## The Journey of A Salty Young Lad

After I had graduated, I had trouble finding a software devlopement role.
I took any jobs I could find at the time. My atest job was plumbing for new construction
and doing service calls on the side. I figured my bad luck at finding an opportunity
for work as a developer was because of covid causing companies to do a hiring
freeze due to unsureness of the situation. After finding I was still having touble
I stumbled across Revurature and found the opportunity to get back into programming
after 2 years.
